The conspiracy theory is false #greensfire

We need a full public inquiry to the causes and the plan to mitigate future fires #auspol forget CChange emotional rhetoric https://www.9news.com.au/national/nsw-bushfires-man-charged-with-deliberately-lighting-fire-in-states-south/ca99d6dd-b7d5-4345-a79c-8a0f5c652dbf …

1212625480630669313 2020-01-02 16:43:38 AEST <Peter90666913> #horsehead and her supporters just can’t wait to sink the boot into Australians in a disastrous time. With #greensfire #firebugs rampant, taking advantage of poor bush and Fire access road upkeeps, we have to swallow this tripe...Go away u clutz #auspol https://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=12297781 …
1212622219555160064 2020-01-02 16:30:41 AEST <safe1970> Yeah they do now the public is sick of their obstruction to just about everything that might make people's lives better. They love the balance of power, now that is gone. hopefully they and their loonie ideals will be gone sooner rather than later. #greensfire #ArsonEmergency

1212617906028068868 2020-01-02 16:13:32 AEST <pc_idiocracy> Let’s take a moment to appreciate how spot on ⁦@mirandadevine⁩ was in her 2009 article on the Victorian bushfires. Zero action has been taken over the last two decades to combat the destruction which we are seeing now. #greensfire  https://www.smh.com.au/environment/green-ideas-must-take-blame-for-deaths-20090211-84mk.html …
1212607788314030081 2020-01-02 15:33:20 AEST <Essy_Bessy> Thank you for killing Australia. Everyone lives in fear because of you. It is what we ever wanted for our home, isn't it? Murderers. #NSWbushfires #greensfire #greens

1208100935961964544 2019-12-21 05:04:43 AEST <Peter90666913> Yes the climate is changing as it always does every year every century. These fires are #greensfire lit by firebug trying to push the #climatechangehoax fools like @AdamBandt and @GretaThunberg will next say that because fires rely on oxygen that oxygen is bad😂😂😂😂 #auspol https://twitter.com/SheElf_1/status/1207102553176952833 …
